          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>
            This project is a Practice Management SaaS platform designed to help dental clinics modernize and improve
            their operations. It's a cloud-based CRM that is accessible from any device and compliant with HIPAA regulations.
            It also includes a patient portal, which is intended to strengthen the connection between clinics, healthcare
            providers, and patients. Overall, this project aims to be a state-of-the-art solution for managing dental practices.
          </p><br><br>

          <h2>Problem Space</h2>
          <p>
            Despite the advancements in technology over the past 30 years, dentistry has remained relatively unchanged.
            Many dental practices still rely on outdated methods, such as paper forms, scanners, and manual communication
            with patients. They also use server-based software that requires expensive equipment and IT support, leading to
            inefficiencies and lost production and revenue for both doctors and staff. It's clear that there is a need for
            more modern, efficient solutions in the dental industry.
          </p>
          <br><br>

          <h2>Opportunity</h2>
          <p>
            There is a significant market opportunity for practice management products in the dental industry. A research
            study by the American Dental Association's Health Policy Institute found that there were 201,117 practicing
            dentists in the United States in 2020. Additionally, the average dental office spends around $15,000 annually
            on software and IT support. This demonstrates a clear demand for such products in the market.

        <h2>Understanding Users</h2>
        <p>
          Before defining the product and it's features, it was essential to understand our users.
          There are two categories of users; the platform's direct customers - dental practices and their staff; and
          the customersâ€™ customers - the patients. There are different user personas within each of these categories
          as shown in the image below-
          <br> <br>
          <a href="images/archy-user-types.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
            <img class="user-flow" src="images/archy-user-types.png" alt="User types">
          </a> <br><br>
      </div>

      <!-- User flows -->

      <div class="">

        <h2>Direct Users - Dental Practices & their Staff</h2>
        <p>After identifying categories of user types, I conducted user interviews and collated information provided
          by the clients to create user personas that defined the goals and frustrations of users within dental practices.</p>
        <br><br>

        <a href="images/archy-user-personas-1.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          <img class="persona-2" src="images/archy-user-personas-1.png" alt="Personas-1">
        </a> <br><br>

        <p>Based on the user interviews and the personas, I created user journey maps to outline daily work flows
          of each user type which ultimately helped in defining the product features and the scope of the product MVP.
          Following are few of the user journey maps-

        <br><br><br>


        <h2>Indirect Users - Patients</h2>
        <p>After identifying the three user types within the indirect users category, I conducted user interviews and
          collated information provided by the clients to create user personas that defined their goals and frustrations.</p>
        <br><br>

        <a href="images/archy-user-personas-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

        </a> <br><br><br>

        <p>To better understand the various stages of a patient's journey, the client provided me with a patient
          lifecycle chart. Using this information, I created a user journey map that outlines the typical experience
          of a patient from pre-appointment to post-appointment.</p><br><br>

      <!-- Competitive Analysis -->

        <hr class="separator">
        <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          After completing user research, it was crucial to carry out a competitive analysis of the existing products.
          For this, we concentrated on a select few leading market players - Dentrix, Mogo, Eaglesoft, Carestream Dental,
          Open Dental; and a few recently launched products - Curve, iDentalSoft and CareStack.
          <br> <br>
        </p>

        </a> <br><br>

        <p>
          The following images are the screenshots of these software to show the state of some of their key features
          such as scheduling, charting, imaging, claim, etc.
          <br> <br>
        </p>

        <a href="images/archy-competitive-analysis-2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">

          <img class="persona-2" src="images/archy-competitive-analysis-3.png" alt="Competitive Analysis of 8 dental practice management software">
        </a> <br><br><br>

        <p>Upon completing this competitive analysis, I found the following insights:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Only three out of these eight products - Dentrix, Carestream & Curve - were cloud based solutions along with
            all the important features </li>
          <li>All the older products, which are currently the biggest market players, lacked modern visual design and
            created cognitive overload due to the way information was displayed.</li>
          <li>These older products also had very inefficient user flows. A simple task, example- processing a claim,
            took more than 50 clicks for the user.</li>
          <li>Products like Open Dental which is one of the most widely used across the US, relied on third party
            integrations for X-ray imaging, payroll, etc. Each third party integration like this costed a practice extra money.</li>
          <li>Many of these products lacked smart features such as preventing claims payments that exceed the total charge
            and automatically calculating a patient's age based on their date of birth. These gaps in functionality increased
            the cognitive load on users and resulted in user input errors.</li>
          <li>Newer products like Curve, iDentalSoft and CareStack could be our strongest competitors, as their visual
            designs were much better than the older products, had an improved user experience and provided
            certain extra features such as smart analytics & reporting. </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Feature Recognition & Prioritization</h2>
        <p>
          The competitive analysis allowed me to gain a thorough understanding of the nuances and complexities of the
          dental industry. It also helped me determine which features were most important to have and to identify
          potential opportunities to differentiate Archy from other competitors in the market by addressing gaps
          in current products.

        <hr class="separator">
        <h2>Wireframes</h2>
        <p>
          I developed several wireframe options for key areas of the product, including scheduling, patients, employees,
          and claims, based on the feature prioritization and information architecture. The wireframing process allowed me
          to determine the amount and type of information that needed to be displayed on each page. This helped me make
          design decisions such as whether to use a list or card format and whether modals or side drawers would be more
          suitable for tasks such as adding new patients or scheduling appointments. After multiple iterations and discussions
          with the client, we ultimately finalized the basic structure and layout of these screens.

        <h2>Building a Design System</h2>

        <p>
          After examining various layout and structure options for the different domains using wireframes, I focused
          on selecting the color palette and fonts to establish the product's visual language. After reviewing various
          options and consulting with the clients, we decided to use shades of blue and green to convey credibility,
          trustworthiness, knowledge, power, and professionalism. Since these qualities are highly valued in the healthcare
          industry, and blue is already widely used by medical providers and organizations, consumers tend to associate
          it with the field of medicine. I further also established the icon styles and created multiple reusable
          components with different states and variants to assist both the clients and developers in understanding the
          nuances and interactions of the product.

        <h2>Takeaways</h2>
        <p>As a UX design lead for the first time, this project allowed me to gain hands-on experience and learn
          valuable insights into the entire product development process, from inception to launch. Through this project,
          I not only only developed my design skills, but also learnt the art of effective communication, client management,
          and collaborating with multidisciplinary teams. Some of the key takeaways from this experience are-</p><br><br>
        <ul>
          <li>The importance of conducting extensive research and asking numerous relevant questions in order to
            fully comprehend the intricacies and subtleties of the the domain you are working in.</li>
          <li>Effective communication and clarity with clients leads to improved outcomes and a more efficient design process.</li>
          <li>Obtaining consistent feedback from users throughout the design process is essential in order to determine
            whether designs decisions are heading in the right direction.</li>
          <li>Techniques for presenting and handing off designs to non-designers, such as clients and developers.</li>
          <li>Strategies for effectively aligning user needs with business goals.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <!--
        <p>During the project, I made some design choices with accessibility and inclusivity in mind, such as including
          the appointment status in text along with color coding, and using a gender-neutral default user image. However,
          I later realized that I had not fully familiarized myself with accessibility guidelines like WCAG 2.0 and how they
          could have enhanced the product. As a result, I made a concerted effort to learn more about accessibility and
          inclusive design during my graduate studies in HCI at UMD.</p><br><br><br> -->
