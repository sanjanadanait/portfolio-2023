        <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
        <p>
          Traffic Management is one of the biggest problems faced by most developing countries today. Cities are getting over
          populated, the use of private cars is increasing, and building additional new infrastructure in congested cities is an
          expensive and herculean task. Traffic woes are also affecting the functioning of emergency vehicles like ambulances,
          fire brigades, which ultimately results in loss of lives. <br>
          In such a scenario, newer, smarter and cost effective solutions have to be implemented. Smart traffic monitoring and
          management is one such way to deal with the ever rising traffic issues in cities. This system will not only reduce traffic woes
          but will eventually also reduce and avoid accidents on roads, lead to less air pollution, and less wastage of fuel.

        <h2>PART 1 BRIEF- CITY TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to the future, where all the vehicles and infrastructure are connected. Design a
          solution for city wide traffic monitoring and management. Start by listing scenarios like traffic analysis, rule violations, etc.
        </p> <br>
        <ul>
          <li>Create wireframes that illustrate the flow of tasks in your solution.</li>
          <li>Clearly articulate user goals and tasks that need to be supported in the UI and how it would help them
            achieve their goals.</li>
          <li>What constraints, requirements, and assumptions are you making with your design? What are the tradeoffs you’re
            making with the design and why?</li>

        <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
        <p>The steps to come up with an efficient solution for traffic management include:</p>

          </a>
        </div>

        <p>
          For the data collection, identifying what scenarios should be monitored is the first step
        </p> <br>

        <h2>Scenarios to be monitored:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Peak traffic timings and routes with usual bottlenecks</li>
          <li>Accident information (accident prone zones, number of accidents per day, fatalities, assistance time)</li>
          <li>Rule violations (Speeding/ Red light violations)</li>
          <li>Parking information (Illegal parking spots, double parking on streets, empty parking spots)</li>
          <li>Traffic signal timings</li>
          <li>Traffic police distribution</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>System Requirements to monitor the scenarios:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Speed sensors</li>
          <li>Smart traffic lights</li>
          <li>Queue Detectors</li>
          <li>Red light violation detection cameras</li>
          <li>Automatic number plate recognition cameras</li>
          <li>V2V communication software</li>
          <li>Variable message sign boards</li>
          <li>Smart parking sensors</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Assumptions:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Availability of smartphones and internet connection with each and every person in the city</li>
          <li>Centralized transport department that handles all public transport as well as roadways</li>
          <li>Centralized city parking system</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Constraints/ Challenges:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Current cities already have infrastructure issues like road planning, zoning, etc. that could pose
            problems when implementing the traffic management system</li>
          <li>Hi tech systems like V2V communication will be present only in newer car models</li>
          <li>All hi tech solutions will need high speed internet connectivity. If at any given time the internet
            connectivity is disrupted, it will disrupt the entire system as it functions on real time data</li>
          <li>Cyber security and data privacy becomes a big challenge as a large number of devices will be
            accessing a central network</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Trade-offs:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Cost</li>
          <li>Time required to implement and install all system requirements</li>

        <h2>USER TYPES & WIREFRAMES</h2>
        <p>
          In this Smart Traffic Management System design, there will be 4 types of end users and their goals will vary
          accordingly. Thus, the system will have to be designed with 4 different user interfaces based on the changing use cases and goals.
        </p> <br>

        <!-- User Type 1 -->

        <h2>User type 1: The Super Admin</h2>
        <p>This user will be the person working in the main traffic control room of the city who will have the most important
          role to play in this system. <br>
          Goals:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Get access to all the data collected by the smart devices within the system</li>
          <li>Analyse the collected data</li>
          <li>Manage traffic, routes, diversions</li>
          <li>Manage users</li>
          <li>Manage traffic police</li>
          <li>View violations, E-challans, accidents data</li>
          <li>Communicate with Sub Admins/ Traffic Polic</li>
        </ul>

        <!-- User Type 2 -->

        <h2>User type 2: The Sub Admin</h2>
        <p>These users will be the ones working in the traffic sub control rooms of the city. For example, in a city
          like Mumbai, apart from the main control room, each ward can have their own traffic sub control room. This way,
          each ward can manage their own traffic police, attend to emergency calls, and diversions if necessary. <br>
          Goals:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Manage traffic & diversions</li>
          <li>Manage and communicate with traffic police</li>
          <li>View accidents data, attend to emergency calls</li>

        <h2>PART 2 BRIEF - TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT APP FOR TRAFFIC POLICE</h2>
        <p>
          To understand the problems specifically faced by traffic police currently and design a user friendly interface for
          a traffic management app.
        </p> <br><br>

        <h2>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h2>
        <p>
          Traffic police have to work in extreme weather conditions and long durations to keep the city traffic in control.
          Controlling congestion and traffic jams during peak hours, festivals, VIP visits, rains as well as managing
          emergency accident cases is a time-consuming and difficult task especially in harsh weather conditions. Sometimes,
          catching violators on roads in peak traffic causes more traffic jams and inconvenience to the traffic police as well
          as the general public. There is a need to come up with easy and quick solutions to make the lives of traffic police easier.
        </p> <br><br>

        <h2>PROJECT OBJECTIVES</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To reduce the manpower required at each major signal/junction which will lead to reduced work hours of traffic
            police constables as well as better manpower distribution to all major junctions of the city</li>
          <li>To reduce number of devices used by the traffic police for monitoring and managing traffic</li>
          <li>Design a system that is easy to use and that reduces time and efforts needed by the user currently to
            perform a certain task</li>
          <li>To make it easier for the traffic police to clock-in & clock-out without having to spend time and
            energy on commuting to the police station</li>
          <li>To make it easier for the traffic police to manage emergency scenarios like accidents, fire, VIP visits, etc.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>

        <h2>USER STUDY</h2>
        <h2>Goals of the user interviews</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To understand the daily schedule of a traffic police constable</li>
          <li>To understand how the current traffic monitoring and management system works</li>
          <li>To understand duties of the traffic police</li>
          <li>To find out about their pain points</li>
          <li>To find out what features of the current system they like</li>
          <li>To understand future traffic monitoring ideas that the government intends to implement</li>
          <li>How do they interact with nearby traffic police?</li>
          <li>How do they interact with the traffic control room?</li>
          <li>Is technology helping in making their jobs easier or is it becoming more difficult?</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Interview Insights</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Currently the traffic police in Mumbai are extremely overworked. Their shift timings can vary from 8-10hrs a
            day and can go up to 14-16hrs a day including the time they spend in commuting.</li>
          <li>Traffic police are required to go to police stations to clock-in before reporting to their assigned
            duty location. This is very time consuming for them and makes their already long hours even more hectic.</li>
          <li>In Mumbai, smart traffic cameras to detect red light violations at major signals and speed violations at highways have
            already been implemented. So the traffic police don’t need to catch these violators on the ground.</li>
          <li>Their duties include catching violations like drivers not wearing helmets, seat belt violations, driving on the
            wrong side, etc. Duties vary according to situations as well, for example, catching violations like not wearing a mask have
            been added to their duties post COVID-19.</li>
          <li>Currently the traffic police system operates in a way where 3-4 constables are assigned at major signals and
            junctions for catching violators and maneuvering traffic jams. Out of the 4 constables, 2 of them handle violations
            and generate E-challans through the handheld challan device. The other 2 constables navigate the traffic.</li>
          <li>Managing too many devices- their mobile phones, walkie talkies, as well as the e challan device is a challenging task.</li>
          <li>Not all traffic police constables are tech savvy and find it difficult to keep up with complex technology.</li>

        <h2>NEXT STEPS</h2>
        <p>This challenge was extremely interesting as it gave me an opportunity to understand how technology and
          product innovation can be implemented in order to make a large scale impact. From here, I would like to continue the
          research and test these wireframes and designs with actual users to get further inputs and suggestions. I will continue
          to explore on how to expand the features and functionalities of this application to efficiently improve the current
          problems in the traffic management system.
