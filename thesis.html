        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          India is a developing country with a strong cultural heritage. In today’s age, where globalization and urbanization are at its peak,
          materialism is paving way for consumerism; western ideas, cultures and products, that are devoid of the characteristics of the particular
          region are gradually coming in. Our society is losing its roots and forgetting the rich culture we proudly boast of. <b>Local artistic practices
            and cultural identities are increasingly facing the challenge of survival.</b> <br><br>
          With rapid development and large-scale migration, the city of Pune in Maharashtra, is changing at a very fast pace. From once being well
          known as the cultural capital of the state, the city has evolved to be known as the educational and IT hub, making it evident that
          globalization is taking more on the cultural front than giving in. Today, the historic old core town of Pune sits in the centre of the city
          much like a decaying heart hidden in this core town are two of its oldest communities of craftsmen- the <em>Tambats</em> (coppersmiths) and
          the <em>Kumbhars</em> (potters) who have been residing here since a few centuries ago. With modernity and globalization changing the face of cities,
          these communities face the danger of extinction and the city faces the danger of losing its living cultural heritage. The question in front of
          us today is, <b>how to rise up from this cultural crisis?</b><br><br>
          Pune currently lies in the labyrinth where globalization and modernity is not a choice but a necessity to fit in the global flows and on
          the other side are the cultural roots which keeps the city bound to its historical past. <b>The key to a mixed cultural development where
            modernity and globalization go hand in hand with the heritage, is <em>‘Branding the Cultural Heritage’</em> to fit in the global economic flow.</b><br><br>
        </p>

      <!-- Introduction -->

      <div id="introduction">
        <hr class="separator">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Pune’s <em>Tambat</em> (coppersmith) community and <em>Kumbhar</em> (potters’) community are ever-diminishing groups of artisans who have fallen
          prey to urbanization, modernization and to the city’s development plan schemes and road widening projects in the past, affecting their livelihood,
          craft and trade. Future development schemes and plans again intend to put their place of trade at risk. Therefore, today, <b>the communities
            that managed to survive for centuries, face the danger of extinction with very few skilled artisans remaining in the community.</b> <br><br>
          On the other hand, creative crafts industries are seeing a sudden boost. In the age of globalisation, where everything is mechanized and mass produced,
          hand crafted products are seeing a boom in usage and demand. In this scenario, the key to a mixed cultural development where modernity and
          globalization go hand in hand with the heritage, is ‘branding the cultural heritage’ to fit in the global economic flow. Branding these
          communities and giving them exposure to a wider audience will not only help prevent the extinction of these two communities, but will also
          safeguard the cultural heritage of the city on a larger scale. The focus of this thesis is now on developing a new perspective- <b>a global
            outlook towards conservation, where the stories and hidden narratives that are associated with these communities are showcased, celebrated
            and framed.</b> <br><br>
          This dissertation presents the study and understanding of the history and evolution of the <em>Tambats</em> and the <em>Kumbhars</em>,
          and the reasons of their decline. It elaborates on the research methodology, literature reviews, data collection and data analysis conducted
          in order to achieve the <b>aim of using a holistic approach through architecture to prevent the extinction of these two communities,
            and to safeguard the cultural heritage of the city on a larger scale.</b><br><br>

          will also have individual and shared workshop spaces that are designed such that monsoons don’t hamper the work of the craftsmen,
          and issues like noise are tackled by using relevant construction technologies and sound absorbing materials. Along with the living

          <b>Design Approach-</b> The new housing will aim to keep the essence of the existing built form i.e. the low building heights to maintain
          the human scale, the courtyards to help retain the community and social aspect, workshop spaces designed to allow interaction amongst the
          artisans during work. New larger workshop spaces will also be designed to promote co-working and collaboration amongst the craftsmen.

        <h2>Design Solution- Site B: Crafts Market + Skill Development Workshops</h2><br>
        <p>
          <b>Crafts Market<br>
            User Groups-</b> a. The Tambats b. The Kumbhars c. Consumers (Locals/ Tourists) <br>
          <b>Functions-</b> The purpose of this market space is to formalize the creative craft sector by providing an independent space which
          will function as a flea market and double up as an exhibition area during tourism festivals. This will give the craftsmen a platform
          to showcase and sell their products without having any middlemen. The shops and stalls of the Kumbhars that are currently at the edge of
          the Veer Santaji Ghorpade Road are at this risk of being razed due to road widening shown in the Development Plan. All these shops will
          be compensated in this new market space with the advantage of not being relocated to a completely new area. <br><br>
          <b>Skill Development Workshops <br>
            User Groups-</b> a. Students b. The craftsmen <br>
          <b>Functions-</b> This architectural intervention will not only serve the purpose of encouraging more people to come and learn these
          crafts and consider taking it up as an occupation, but will also provide economic benefits to the craftsmen. Along with teaching their
          artisanal skills, this space will also provide skill development for the craftsmen in areas such as design, marketing, and entrepreneurship.
          This intervention will also function as an organization for the craftsmen to form a cluster, formalize the occupation and come up
          with quality standards. <br><br>
          <b>Design Approach-</b> The aim here was to create a modern built form while also bringing in certain architectural qualities and
          materials of Pune’s vernacular architecture and the essence of the two communities. The timbrel vault symbolises how traditional
          materials like brick can be used to create something completely new and innovative. This intervention breaks away from the norm of
          isolating learning spaces, and conventional market spaces. The crafts market and workshops have been integrated together to manifest as
          a porous and inviting design, and to encourage interaction among all user groups. The workshop spaces are designed taking into consideration
          problems such as noise impact of the Tambat craft and smoke impact of the kilns used for pottery.

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
          This thesis project involving research, site study, analysis and translation of research findings into
          creative architectural design solutions was a challenging yet fulfilling journey for me. It imbibed in me, a sense of appreciation
          for people, and made me understand the importance of asking the right questions in order to design the right solutions.
          Exploring different architectural forms and learning new software to create those forms was also a challenging experience. The year-long
          thesis culminated in a jury wherein I presented my work and was appreciated for my empathetic and thorough research, bold yet functional
          design solutions, incorporation of new construction methodology and crisp presentation skills. <br><br>
